# Hey there 👋, I'm Hima!

Welcome to my personal portfolio.  
I'm just a 14-year-old guy who's super passionate about coding and building cool stuff on the web 💻

## 🌟 About Me

Right now, I'm still learning and experimenting — but I’ve already finished a full Web Development course on **SoloLearn**, where I learned the basics of:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

I actually built my first Roblox game when I was only 9! Crazy, right? 😄  
If you wanna check it out, here’s the link:

## 💡 Projects

Here are a few things I’ve built so far (more coming soon!):

Just a basic calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🏆 Certificates

I’m proud to say I earned some certificates from SoloLearn along the way:
